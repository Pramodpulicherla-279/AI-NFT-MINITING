# AI-NFT-MINITING

📖 Digital Library with NFT-Signed Assets

A decentralized Digital Library where contributors create AI-generated images, sign them with NFTs, and protect ownership rights. Each contributor’s creativity is tokenized and secured, ensuring exclusive ownership while preventing unauthorized access.

✨ Features

🎨 AI-Powered Creativity – Contributors generate images using AI prompts.

🔗 NFT-Signed Assets – Every image is minted as an NFT on the Cardano blockchain.

🔒 Ownership Protection – Contributors cannot access or duplicate others’ digital assets.

🌍 Decentralized Library – Transparent, immutable, and verifiable on-chain records.

📂 Secure Metadata Storage – Assets linked to IPFS/DB with CIP-25 metadata standard.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Frontend → Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS

Blockchain → Cardano + MeshJS + Blockfrost API

Smart Contract → Plutus Minting Policy (NFT signing logic)

Storage → IPFS / Database for metadata + assets

Backend → Node.js / FastAPI (API handling)
